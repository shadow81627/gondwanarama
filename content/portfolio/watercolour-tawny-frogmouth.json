  "description": "This painting features a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strixoides), an Australian native bird of prey, master of camouflage and (in my informed opinion) the coolest almost-owl-but-not-quite you'll found in your suburban backyard. This artwork is a high-quality reproduction of an original watercolour painting, printed on 320gsm textured cotton rag. Various sizes are available, and I can also arrange custom sizes, shapes and margin widths upon request via DM. This painting would look great in a coloured or wooden frame. If you'd like to give this item as a gift, I can arrange high-quality framing upon request (though this will require longer processing time and a higher price). ",
