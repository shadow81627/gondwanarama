  "description": "This humpback whale swims through the sky, floating in a watercolour galaxy peppered with golden stars. This is a high-quality reproduction of a watercolour and gold gouache original painting, printed on 320gsm textured cotton rag. Various sizes are available, and I can also arrange custom sizes, shapes and margin widths upon request via DM. This painting would look great in a gold or wooden frame, either by itself or paired with other paintings from this series. If you'd like to give this item as a gift, I can arrange high-quality framing upon request (though this will require longer processing time and a higher price)."
