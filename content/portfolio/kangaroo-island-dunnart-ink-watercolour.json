  "description": "This artwork was painted during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, an unprecedented season of disaster that affected almost an entire continent's worth of people and ecosystems. It shows a Kangaroo Island dunnart, one of the many quiet victims of these fires - there were barely 300 remaining before Kangaroo Island burned, and with 2/3 of their ecosystem destroyed and the unburned rest still threatened by feral cats, it seemed like this species might be one of the first extinctions of the new decade. At the time, I felt like the only thing I could do was mourn the loss by drawing it. Most Australians don't know what a dunnart is, and I created this because I wanted people to see it and understand what was lost. As it turned out, there's hope for the KI dunnarts yet. A few have been spotted on camera traps around the island, and are being carefully fenced off from feral cats by dedicated researchers and volunteers. I feel much more hopeful about this artwork now, and I hope it can do some good of its own: 100% of the proceeds from this sale will go to FAME (Foundation for Australia's Most Endangered Species), to assist in their project to monitor and protect the surviving KI dunnarts, control feral predators, and revegetate Kangaroo Island."
