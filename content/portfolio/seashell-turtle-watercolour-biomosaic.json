  "description": "This work is part of my Biomosaic series, in which I draw & paint Australian native animals using the flora from the ecosystems around them. I painted this one while staying at Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island), and everything in it is a creature I found when I was poking around the rockpools one afternoon at Frenchman's beach. As kids, we once found the skeleton of a huge green sea turtle washed up on the same headland, and I've always loved that spot for being a little jungle of rock-critters and weird ocean flotsam. I wanted this artwork to tie all of those things together - the big, charismatic species we all know and get excited to see, with the mosaic of smaller, weirder, infinitely diverse critters that keep their ecosystems ticking along. I hope looking at this artwork feels the way picking through rockpools does - full of cool little treasures hidden away in unlikely crevices, all forming a complex, living whole when you step back.",
